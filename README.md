# Tempus Dominus Bootstrap 4
![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/tempusdominus%2Fbootstrap-4-datetimepicker.png)

# Version 5
This is the Bootstrap 4 component of the new Version 5. This is a "scorched earth" version and there are **a lot** of breaking changes.

The new picker under the "Tempus Dominus" brand will be completely modular. The goal is to separate the core functions into its own library with specific modules for Bootstrap 3, Bootstrap 4, and possibly other UI frameworks.

This new version has been completely rewritten in ES6 and uses Babel to transpile the code down.
